# 1. Add argument for creation of legend in image plot. Use image.plot() from library(fields) instead?
# 2. Better plotting of factors in image.plot.mask
# 3. Update documentation, including:
#    b. Make help for "secrgam" rather than (or as well as) "secrgam-package"
# 4. PlotDgam: 
#    a. ?Fix CI bound plotting in plotDgam (missing beta_0?)
#    b. Add option not to plot CI?
#    c. (Maybe) rename "plotDgam" to "plotsmooth"?
#    d. Bivariates smooths: plot marginals and 3D plot?
#    e. Adapt plotDgam to plot 1D smooths when there are some multivariate smooth terms
# 10. Add option to plot relative SE to plot.secrgam?
# 11. Temporal smooths with Session.
# 12. fitted.secrgam vs region.ND?
# 13. Fix AIC.secrgam( ) so that it works even if 1st object is class secr rather than secrgam
# 14. Easy function for plotting ovenbird predictions?
